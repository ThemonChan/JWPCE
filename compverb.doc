COMPVERB
========

COMPVERB is a list of Japanese compound verbs, and is based on the 
excellent book "Handbook of Japanese Compound Verbs" by Yoshiko
Tagashira and Jean Hoff (Hokuseido Press, 1986). The file could be viewed
as an electronic companion to the book as it is based on the 1100+ verbs
listed as an appendix in the book, and includes the numbers from the book
to enable cross-referencing.

Each line is in "EDICT" format (qv) and consists of the verb, its reading,
and its English translation. At the end is the verb's number in the
Tagashira/Hoff book (1-1157). Where the verb is one of the 200 expanded
upon in the book, this is shown as a second part to the number.

Thanks to Charles Eicher (ceicher@inav.net) who suggested compiling the
glossary, and to the good people in the hon'yaku mailing list who helped
fill in the meanings of the last few elusive verbs.

If you're curious as to how the list was done, I scanned in the romaji
list from the back of the book, converted it (automatically) to kana and
did a programmed match against the EDICT file, plus a few other files in
my possession. Then I hand-edited the result, filling in the gaps as I
went.

Don't bother merging this file with the EDICT file. As of the latest
version of EDICT, they are all there.
