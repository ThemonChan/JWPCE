Dictionary file of geological terms

The GEODIC file is a collection of geological terms in the EDICT format.
(Please see the EDICT.DOC file for more information about the format 
and usage.)

The material in the GEODIC file has come from two sources:

(a) a file prepared by Bruce Bain, which he sent to me in mid-1996, and
which I filed in the wrong directory and overlooked until recently. I'll
append the .doc file Bruce prepared.

(b) another file of terms entered by Leslie Oberman
(oberman@tmxmelb.mhs.oz.au). Leslie has been translating a book on
the geology of Hokkaidou, and compiled the file while undertaking that
task

Leslie called on me recently with his file to see if it was suitable to
put out on the Internet. That reminded me of Bruce's file, which I
eventually found. With Leslie's agreement I have merged the two (they
complemented nicely). I haven't been able to contact Bruce, so I 
apologize for releasing this merged edition without his approval.

So here it is. I'm happy to look after amendments.

Here is my list of geology terms in EDICT format which I put together for
some translation work on concrete materials. It contains about 430 entries.
Many of the term have been checked against the source: "Doboku Wa-Ei
Jiten" by Kindai Tosho K.K.
