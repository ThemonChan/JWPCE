J_PLACES
========

The "j_places" file is an EDICT-format compilation of Japanese
place names extracted from the postal code databases published on 
the Japanese MPT WWW pages. I set the file up some time ago to
include on my WWWJDIC server, rebuilt the file in January 1999,
and finally by public demand I have put it on my ftp archive.

The place names are catgorized: pref(ecture)/city/loc(ation), according
to what is in the database.
